# Simple-Blockchain-Mining-Simulation-using-SHA-256
This project demonstrates a basic Proof-of-Work mining algorithm similar to how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin perform mining. It uses the SHA-256 hash function to find a valid block hash that meets a specified difficulty level by brute-force searching over nonces.
